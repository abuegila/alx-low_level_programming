## Overview

This repository contains various C programs designed to introduce and practice fundamental concepts in low-level programming. Each program is carefully crafted to demonstrate specific aspects of C programming, including:

- **Variables:** Declaring, initializing, and using variables of different data types.
  
- **If-Else Statements:** Implementing conditional logic to control program flow based on conditions.

- **While Loops:** Utilizing while loops for repetitive tasks until a condition is no longer met.
