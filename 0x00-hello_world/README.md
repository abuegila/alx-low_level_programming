# 0x00. C - Hello, World

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program, focusing on foundational C programming concepts. The main objective is to understand the basics of C programming including syntax, compilation, and execution of C programs.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic programming in C, including compiling and executing simple programs. The exercises will guide you through the fundamental constructs of C programming.

## Contents

This directory contains the following files, each serving different learning purposes:

- **hello_world.c**: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.
- **1-compiler**: A script to compile the basic "Hello, World!" program.
- **2-assembler**: A script to assemble the source code file into an object file.
- **3-name**: A script to generate the name of the compiled executable.
- **4-puts.c**: A program that prints a different message using the `puts` function.
- **5-printf.c**: A program that prints a message using the `printf` function.
- **6-size.c**: A program that displays the size of various data types in C.

## Compiling and Running the Programs

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
